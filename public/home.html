                transferred on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network.Bitcoin transactions are verified
                by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger
                called a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person
                or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009,
                when its implementation was released as open-source software.

                Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract
                functionality. Ether (Abbreviation: ETH;[a] sign: Ξ) is the native cryptocurrency of
                the platform. Among cryptocurrencies, ether is second only to bitcoin in market
                capitalization.[3][4]

                Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin.[5] Additional founders
                of Ethereum included Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio and Joseph
                Lubin.[6] In 2014, development work began and was crowdfunded, and the network went
                live on 30 July 2015.[7] Ethereum allows anyone to deploy permanent and immutable
                decentralized applications onto it, with which users can interact.[8] Decentralized
                finance (DeFi) applications provide a broad array of financial services without the
                need for typical financial intermediaries like brokerages, exchanges, or banks, such
                as allowing cryptocurrency users to borrow against their holdings or lend them out
                for interest</p>

                Cardano is a public blockchain platform. It is open-source and decentralized,
                with consensus achieved using proof of stake. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions
                with its internal cryptocurrency, ADA.[4] Cardano was founded in 2015 by Ethereum
                co-founder Charles Hoskinson. The development of the project is overseen and supervised
                by the Cardano Foundation based in Zug, Switzerland.[5][6] It is the largest cryptocurrency
                to use a proof-of-stake blockchain, which is seen as a greener alternative to proof-of-work protocols
